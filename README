Do you know the words "visual glitch" or "monkey glitch" ?
I knew the words at ucnv's talk on RubyKaigi2011.(http://rubykaigi.org/2011/en/schedule/details/18S02)
I was fascinated with his talk and I want to make "glitch". This application make real-time "glitch" through your android phone's camera.
I wrote how to use this application in http://bugcloud.com/?p=1331.
